                    <p class="border-text">Martin Taylor was born on October 20, 1996. Raised in a music heritage and gypsy tradition, he began learning guitar at the tender age of four. His father, William Taylor, took up jazz bass at 30. His father often played music by Quintette du Hot Club de France, whose guitarist was Django Reinhardt. So from the beginning of his learning journey, he was inspired by this guitarist. By the age of 8, he was already playing in his father’s band, and by 15 he had quit school to pursue music full-time.

                        He joined the band  Oo-yah Band, Over the next several years he performed at holiday camps, cruise ships, and radios. One of his gigs brought him to London where he met Ike Isaacs, who would become an important figure in his career. Ike Isaacs mentored him and helped him develop his sense of jazz harmony as well as his fingerstyle technique. Through Isaacs, he was introduced to Stéphane Grappelli, who played with Reinhardt in Quintette du Hot Club de France.

                    <p class="border-text"> When one of Grappelli’s bandmates was injured, Taylor was invited to play for several European gigs. He was later invited to play full time. For the next eleven years, he played with Grappelli. His association with Grappeli helped reach a large audience, especially in North America. This led him to work with other popular musicians like Chet Atkins, Joe Pass, Tal Farlow, Barney Kessel, and Herb Ellis.
