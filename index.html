                    <img src="images\kid01.jpg" class="picture" alt="Martin Taylor as a kid playing the guitar">
                    <p>Martin Taylor was born on October 20, 1996. Raised in a music heritage and gypsy tradition, he began learning guitar at the tender age of four. His father, William Taylor, took up jazz bass at 30. His father often played music by Quintette du Hot Club de France, whose guitarist was Django Reinhardt. So from the beginning of his learning journey, he was inspired by this guitarist. By the age of 8, he was already playing in his father’s band, and by 15 he had quit school to pursue music full-time.
